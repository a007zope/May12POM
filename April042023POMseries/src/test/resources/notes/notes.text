Page:
1)for every page in web/mobile app, we need to  create separate page java class.
2) Never use assertions in page class
3) Page actions needs to provide page behaviour.
4) Page locators(By) should be private and will be accessed via public page actions.


Test:1) Have to use a test client : TestNG/Junit/pytest/Nunit/Jasmine/Mocha.
2) Assertions should be written in test class
3) Never use driver apis in test class
